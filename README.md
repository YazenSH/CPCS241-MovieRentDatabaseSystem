# CPCS241-MovieRentDatabaseSystem
The system is essentially a database for renting films. I usedÂ procedures and functions in this project to make inserting data for non-database users more simpler.


All files are working in Oracle Live.

steps for my files:

1. Copy all table_Creation files and run them on Oracle Work Cheat.
2. Start copying all procedures one by one from each file alone; it won't work adding them all in one run.
3. Copy the insertion data file and run its content. It will print 70 for the close transaction procedure because I set the end time to 7 days.
4. Copy query files all together or one by one; it will work either way.
